Version 3 Data

Geographic school district achievement estimates,  long by grade-year-subject (gyb).  Estimates are in a cohort standardized (CS) scale using the cohort that was in 4th grade in Spring 2009 (assuming usual grade promotion). This metric scales the NAEP performance estimates so that they are in standard deviations of the national grade-subject-specific performance of this single cohort. Estimates in this scale are comparable across the whole country and over time, but not across grades or subjects.  See section 7 "Scaling the Estimates" in the technical documentation, and Reardon, Kalogrides, and Ho (2017), for details.
